# Inequality Of Wealth In America

## Synopsis

Visualization of income and wealth distribution in USA

## Abstract

Our perception of the distribution of wealth in America is not quite accurate, especially in terms of inequalities and the actual real numbers.  Are only the top 10% earners in the economy living the “life of luxury”, and the other 90% getting the scraps?  How much money does it take to “feel rich” in America?

## Motivation

Some of us make a six figure income, or are in the top 20% earners in America.  The problem is we still don’t “feel” rich.  Why is that?
In the movies you see people with the super sports car, or the huge mansion, but in reality it earning that low six figure income might not give you those things at all.
Are only the top 10% earners in the economy living “life of luxury”, and the other 90% getting the scraps?  What about the top 1%, or better yet the top 400 earners  in America.  How much better of a life are they living then the rest of the United States?

## Use Case

You are a college graduate, with a couple years of experience under your belt. You are earning a low six figure income. The money you are earning is more than most of your friends and family, yet you still don’t “feel rich”. You are curious to see how your income stacks up against the rest of the United States.
