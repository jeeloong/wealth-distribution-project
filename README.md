## Motivation

Some of us make a six figure income, or are in the top 20% earners in America.  The problem is we still don’t “feel” rich.  Why is that?
In the movies you see people with the super sports car, or the huge mansion, but in reality it earning that low six figure income might not give you those things at all.
Are only the top 10% earners in the economy living “life of luxury”, and the other 90% getting the scraps?  What about the top 1%, or better yet the top 400 earners  in America.  How much better of a life are they living then the rest of the United States?
